<!-- Two-Way Binding
We intend to display the name of the hero in the <input>, change it, and see those changes wherever we bind to the heroâ€™s name. In short, we want two-way data binding. -->

<!-- AngularJS directives are extended HTML attributes with the prefix ng-.  We use the ngModel built-in directive for two-way binding. -->

<!-- Let's ensure that edits to a hero's name aren't lost. Start by adding, to the end of the hero detail template, a save button with a click event binding that invokes a new component method named save: -->
